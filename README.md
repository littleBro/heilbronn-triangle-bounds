# Heilbronn triangle bounds: finite packings and improved scales

A conditional research draft by **[Ivan Blinov (@littleBro)](https://github.com/littleBro)**, extending [OpenAI math family 191](https://github.com/openai/math/tree/fd4aeeb2ee4fc729c18d98444fed42fd0529eeeb/preprints/A-power-improvement-in-the-Heilbronn-triangle-lower-bound-September-25-2026), with OpenAI Codex assistance.

The current version compresses the field-norm determinant decomposition before packing its summands. With dimension d = 13 and the retained slab scales, it gives the **conditional paper exponent**

$$
\Delta(n)\ge c\,n^{-2+\eta},\qquad
\boxed{\eta=\frac{1}{498\cdot47^{10}+7}\approx3.81761455590365\cdot10^{-20}}.
$$

The claim is for every sufficiently large n, conditional on the pinned manuscript's geometric estimates. The new norm decomposition and interpolation descent have a written algebraic proof and finite controls. Lean checks the permutation normalization and signs, the complete new finite packing and selected scale inequalities. The field-algebra argument, slab geometry and full Heilbronn theorem are not completely formalized in Lean.

Run all retained results with Python 3.11+, Git and the pinned Lean 4.11.0 toolchain:

    python scripts/verify_all.py

On systems with Make, make verify runs the same checks. The command also requires all twelve certificates and patches to regenerate byte for byte.

| Packing | k | Conditional paper exponent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pinned manuscript | T² + 1 | ≈ 3.17571403643291e-236 |
| Preserved ternary baseline | 3^384 | ≈ 2.68582462243153e-188 |
| Centered sphere | 40011^29 | ≈ 1.51508393214748e-138 |
| Retuned scales, d = 13 | 403^17 | ≈ 4.77320332233169e-48 |
| Slab cap, d = 13 | 403^17 | ≈ 1.02940168035828e-47 |
| Central energy interval, d = 13 | 379^17 | ≈ 2.92350666167202e-47 |
| Compressed norm, d = 13 | 47^10 | ≈ 3.81761455590365e-20 |

The current exponent is approximately 1.30583405399879e27 times the previous central-layer exponent. That checkpoint was approximately 2.84000572124043 times the slab exponent. These are comparisons of exponents in asymptotic lower bounds for minimum triangle area; thresholds and constants remain unspecified.

The new term bound is T = 37 * 6^12 = 80,540,946,432, replacing binom(binom(51,13),3) ≈ 1.8e34. For this smaller T, the full-range sphere bound suffices: words of length 10 over 24 digits, encoded in base 47, have at most 661 energies and 24^10 >= 661 T. Lean selects the needed distinct words from one layer and proves the packing. The enormous sphere is not enumerated.

## Current result: compress the norm expansion

The norm polynomial is a product of d conjugate 3-by-3 determinants. In its permutation expansion, normalize the first permutation to the identity. Because d = 13 is odd, each group of six terms is a determinant, leaving 6^12 determinants over the extension field.

To express them over the base field, represent coefficients in a power basis of degree 13. Each resulting determinant is a polynomial of degree at most 36 in the basis variable. Interpolation at 37 distinct base-field nodes, followed by a linear projection fixing the base field, expresses it as at most 37 base-field determinants. This projects the whole determinant, rather than assuming that entrywise projection preserves it. It requires only primes r >= 37.

The result is the same exact norm identity with T = 37 * 6^12 homogeneous polynomials per row. The distinct-label obstruction and the conditional digit estimate retain their original interfaces; the latter already permits arbitrary functions of the labels. With the existing slab scales, eta remains 1/(498k + 7), now at k = 47^10.

The checker tests the full decomposition on four matrices each over F_(11^3) and F_(17^5), including distinct Vandermonde labels. It checks descent on all 37 basis monomials and four matrices over F_(41^13), without enumerating the degree-13 norm expansion. Negative controls detect omitted signs, entrywise projection, insufficient nodes, corrupted weights and the even-degree sign error. The general field-algebra proof is written; these finite controls do not replace it. No novelty or optimality claim is made.

## Preserved second-moment count

For each digit t, put j(t) = ((2t − 189)² − 1)/8. Its mean is 1504, so the energy index J of a word has mean 25,568. The sum of squared centered digit scores is 343,855,008. Over all 190^17 words, the second moment is

    V = 17 * 190^16 * 343855008.

Outside 15,568 <= J <= 35,568, the centered score has absolute value at least 10,001. At most floor(V/10001²) words lie outside. The exact inequality

    V + 20001 * T * 10001² <= 190^17 * 10001²

therefore supplies a large enough energy layer. The existing carry-free encoding and slab scales give k = 379^17 and eta = 1/(498k + 7).

The checker independently propagates moments, tests six small Cartesian products, rejects six corrupted certificates, rebuilds the Lean dependencies, audits logical axioms and checks patch applicability. Lean evaluates only the 190 digit scores and a 17-step recurrence. The parameter choice is an explicit feasible witness; no optimality claim is made.

## Preserved slab cap

The short-relation exclusion in upstream Section 5 only bounds the first coordinate. Take

    S = {(x, y, x² − νy²): 0 <= x < w, y in F_q},

where ν is a nonsquare and w = floor(q/(1000 H²)). This is a subset of the same elliptic paraboloid, with no three collinear points and exactly wq points. The allowed shifts and inclusion-probability argument still apply. Thus s >= q²/(2000 H²), improving the previous q²/(2000³ H⁶) bound.

With H = 2h, the three degenerate losses become h⁶/q, h⁴/q and h⁶/q². They stay bounded for h⁶ < q <= 2h⁶. Keeping the digit scale and N = (hq)⁴ gives rho = 498k + 6 and eta = 1/(498k + 7). This checkpoint uses k = 403^17; the current version retains the slab argument with the smaller packing.

The checker independently derives the rational exponent, checks small caps and allowed shifts, rejects corrupted certificates and invalid scale choices, rebuilds the Lean dependencies and checks the patch against the original sources. Lean proves the floor-width and cardinality bounds, the modulus and zero-case inequalities, the deletion arithmetic, and an exact gain between 2.15 and 2.16. The cap geometry itself is a written proof, with finite checks as supporting evidence.

The checkpoint changes are L = 400 k² r⁴, H = 2h, q between h¹⁴ and 2h¹⁴, and N = (hq)⁴. The conditional digit moment remains at most 2. All three degenerate zero-determinant cases have bounded contributions. Taking rho = 1074k + 6 and sample growth r^gamma with gamma = rho/(2rho + 1) permits d = 13 and yields the retained exponent 1/(1074k + 7).

Lean checks the complete new finite packing, the binomial formula for T, the capacity inequality, integer scale bounds, cleared-denominator deletion constraints, the exponent identity, and the gain enclosure. The verifier rebuilds the imported sphere proof, checks source hashes and patch applicability, and rejects four corrupted certificates and five parameter changes that break the stated sufficient bounds.

The field-norm, lattice, probability, asymptotic deletion, and interpolation arguments remain written conditional mathematics. They are not a complete Lean proof of the geometric theorem. The very small negative collision exponent can require enormous thresholds; no practical finite-size improvement is claimed.

**The complete finite sphere packing is now proved in Lean.** This includes the energy-layer bound, a finite pigeonhole theorem, selection of T distinct words from one layer, encoding, bounds, injectivity, and matching. The final theorem also checks T using the falling-factorial quotient definition of binomial coefficients. No sufficiently large sphere is assumed as a precondition, and the enormous set is never enumerated during proof checking.

The baseline theorem is paper_packing_binomial in Sphere.lean; the retuned specialization is tuned_packing in Tuned.lean. The central-layer checkpoint is central_packing_binomial in Central.lean. The current theorem is norm_packing in NormCompression.lean, with the new term-count formula. They use only standard Lean logical axioms; the numeric comparisons use no axioms. None of these versions formally proves the complete geometric theorem or parameter-comparison optimality.

The sphere idea is classical Behrend; stronger progression-free-set constructions are known ([Elsholtz, Hunter, Proske, Sauermann](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12290)). We claim neither a new sphere method nor unrestricted optimality. The certificate records a bounded comparison of dimensions 3–284 under its sufficient-capacity criterion.

All six source patches apply directly to the original manuscript and are alternatives; do not apply them cumulatively.

## Preserved ternary baseline

- A universal Lean proof of the replacement packing, including bounds, row injectivity, and the actual binary-index producer.
- Exact arithmetic for the manuscript's parameters, computed independently in two ways; Lean also checks capacity and denominator comparisons for the copied T literal.
- A written conditional transfer through the determinant coefficient, carries, conditional digit distribution, orbit inputs, deletion, and interpolation.
- A separate patch against the pinned manuscript. Original sources remain unchanged.

The full geometric theorem is conditional on the upstream estimates listed in the note. Our Lean file does not prove those estimates or the complete Heilbronn result. The original upstream Lean comparator uses a different exponent and a subsequence statement; it has not been rerun or modified.

The ternary progression-free construction is classical ([Moy and Rolnick, Section 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06013)). Novelty of this application, optimality, and independent mathematical review are not established.

The key substitution is m = ceil(log2(T)), k = 3^m. Write the binary digits of a as a ternary number u(a), and use positions u(a), u(a), k−1−2u(a) in the three rows. Their sum equals k−1 exactly when all three indices agree. At the manuscript's T, m = 384.

## Reproduce

Requirements: Python 3.11 or later (standard library only), Git, and native Lean 4.11.0. The local run used Python 3.14.4 on Windows. No Mathlib, WSL, parallel search, or geometric sampling workload is required. Install the pinned toolchain with elan before verification; see the [reproduction guide](docs/reproducibility.md).

From this directory:

    python scripts/verify_all.py

To regenerate the deterministic certificate and patch:

    python scripts/build_certificate.py
    python scripts/build_patch.py
    python scripts/verify.py

The verifier preserves upstream files, compiles only the local proof, rejects changed source hashes, and checks patch applicability. Its finite tests cover 21 packing sizes, 12 coefficient/carry examples, and six negative controls. Finite coverage is separate from the universal Lean theorem.

The arithmetic and packing checks do not independently validate the upstream paper. The preserved ternary proof uses a copied T literal checked by Python; the earlier sphere proofs check their binomial counts inside Lean. The current packing uses the new formula T = 37 * 6^12. See the respective proof notes for their scopes.

The proof notes are supplied as TeX. The current note, including norm compression, compiled successfully with the built-in Tectonic 0.17.0+20260731 after installing its support bundle from the [official v33 mirror](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic-relay-service/blob/main/temporary_redirects.map). The source hash and bundle identity are recorded in [the compilation report](artifacts/sphere-latex-status.json). Generated note PDFs are not included. The separate artifacts/latex-status.json retains the earlier ternary-note attempt. Note compilation is separate from the Lean and Python checks.

The [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/verify.yml) runs the same checks on Ubuntu and saves verification reports. See [Actions](https://github.com/littleBro/heilbronn-triangle-bounds/actions/workflows/verify.yml) for the result on a particular commit. Local reports and remote runs record their own environments.

CI also scans Git history and checked-out files for exposed secrets before proof verification. See [the security controls and publication checklist](docs/security.md) and [security reporting](SECURITY.md).
